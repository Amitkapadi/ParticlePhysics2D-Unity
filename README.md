ParticlePhysics2D-Unity
=======================

A fast and stable particle based physics 2D engine for Unity 3D.


### Brief
ParticlePhysics2D for Unity is originally ported from JEFFREY BERNSTEIN's TRAER.PHYSICS 3.0.<br />
With existing Modified Euler Intergration and Runge Kutta Integration, another Verlet Integration is also added.

### Todo
1. More unity compatible. <br />
2. Integration with unity's physics 2d primitives. <br />
3. Unity editor tool to create ParticlePhysics2D system in design time. <br />



Any feedback is greatly welcome.<br />
